      <description>[Updated on 2019-05-27: add the section on Lottery Ticket Hypothesis.]
If you are like me, entering into the field of deep learning with experience in traditional machine learning, you may often ponder over this question: Since a typical deep neural network has so many parameters and training error can easily be perfect, it should surely suffer from substantial overfitting. How could it be ever generalized to out-of-sample data points?
The effort in understanding why deep neural networks can generalize somehow reminds me of this interesting paper on System Biology &amp;mdash; &amp;ldquo;Can a biologist fix a radio?</description>

      <description>Professor Naftali Tishby passed away in 2021. Hope the post can introduce his cool idea of information bottleneck to more people.
Recently I watched the talk &amp;ldquo;Information Theory in Deep Learning&amp;rdquo; by Prof Naftali Tishby and found it very interesting. He presented how to apply the information theory to study the growth and transformation of deep neural networks during training. Using the Information Bottleneck (IB) method, he proposed a new learning bound for deep neural networks (DNN), as the traditional learning theory fails due to the exponentially large number of parameters.</description>

      <title>How to Explain the Prediction of a Machine Learning Model?</title>

      <description>The machine learning models have started penetrating into critical areas like health care, justice systems, and financial industry. Thus to figure out how the models make the decisions and make sure the decisioning process is aligned with the ethnic requirements or legal regulations becomes a necessity.
Meanwhile, the rapid growth of deep learning models pushes the requirement of interpreting complicated models further. People are eager to apply the power of AI fully on key aspects of everyday life.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Deep Learning for Curious People</title>

      <description>(The post was originated from my talk for WiMLDS x Fintech meetup hosted by Affirm.)
I believe many of you have watched or heard of the games between AlphaGo and professional Go player Lee Sedol in 2016. Lee has the highest rank of nine dan and many world championships. No doubt, he is one of the best Go players in the world, but he lost by 1-4 in this series versus AlphaGo.</description>
